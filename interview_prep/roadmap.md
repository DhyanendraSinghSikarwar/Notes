---

## **Phase 4: Applications & Networking (Weeks 10–24, overlap with interviews)**

1. **Target Companies**

   * Mid / Senior DS roles, startups or tech hubs
   * Examples: Booking.com, Zalando, Revolut, Delivery Hero, Siemens, Bosch, Microsoft, Amazon EU
2. **Platforms to Apply**

   * LinkedIn Jobs (filter: visa sponsorship / relocation)
   * Relocate.me
   * Wellfound (ex-AngelList)
   * Glassdoor Europe
   * Stack Overflow Jobs
3. **Networking**

   * Connect with EU-based DS professionals
   * Join LinkedIn groups & Slack communities (e.g., “Data Scientists Europe”, “AI in Germany”)
   * Ask for referrals and insights on interviews

---

## **Phase 5: Visa & Relocation Prep**

* Understand EU Blue Card / Highly Skilled Worker requirements
* Prepare documents: passport, degree certificates, experience letters, reference letters
* Once offer is received, coordinate with HR for visa processing
* Be aware of **tax rules & cost of living** in the target country

---

## **Phase 6: Continuous Learning & Portfolio (Ongoing)**

* 2–3 ongoing projects:

  * End-to-end ML pipeline (Data → Model → Deployment → Dashboard)
  * Advanced analytics projects (recommendation systems, NLP, time series)
  * Open-source contributions or Kaggle competitions
* Update GitHub + Kaggle regularly
* Stay updated with AI/ML & Big Data trends

### **Suggested Timeline Overview**

| Weeks   | Focus Area                                                         |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0–1     | Self-assessment, profile, goal-setting                             |
| 1–6     | Core technical skills (Python, SQL, ML, Stats, business analytics) |
| 7–12    | Advanced skills (ML Ops, Big Data, Cloud, soft skills)             |
| 13–20   | Interview preparation (technical + business + mock interviews)     |
| 10–24   | Applications & networking (overlaps with interviews)               |
| Ongoing | Portfolio projects + continuous learning                           |

### **Key Tips**

* **Portfolio > Certifications**: Hiring managers want proof of real impact.
* **English communication matters**: European companies often prioritize clear communication over perfection in coding syntax.
* **Networking is crucial**: EU companies are smaller than FAANG; referrals can speed up your process.
* **Target roles with sponsorship**: Not all companies will sponsor; filter by visa/relocation.

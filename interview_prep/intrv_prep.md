 **how to use them effectively** for practicing **coding and SQL**, specifically focusing on arrays, strings, dictionaries (Python), and joins/window functions (SQL). I’ll also explain a **daily routine** so your 4+ yrs experience aligns with mid-senior DS roles.

---

## **1. LeetCode (Python / SQL)**

**Purpose:** Algorithmic coding, data structures, and SQL queries (widely used in DS interviews).

**Setup:**

* Create an account: [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com)
* Choose **“Python”** for coding, **SQL** for database questions.
* Use the **“Explore”** section for DS/SQL patterns.

**How to use:**

* Filter by difficulty: Medium / Easy → gradually move to Hard.
* Tag filters:

  * **Python coding:** Arrays, Strings, Hash Table (for dictionaries), Linked List, DP (optional for DS interviews)
  * **SQL:** Joins, Group By, Window Functions
* Solve **1–2 problems daily**. Don’t just submit — write a clean solution, optimize, and understand the complexity.
* Use **Discuss / Solutions tab** after submission to see alternative approaches.

**Routine Example:**

* Day 1: Python arrays problem (two-sum variant)
* Day 2: SQL query with join + aggregation
* Day 3: Python dictionary (frequency count)
* Day 4: SQL window function (ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), etc.)

## **2. HackerRank (Python / SQL / DS)**

**Purpose:** Hands-on coding & SQL practice with a more guided environment than LeetCode. Good for **interview-style questions**.

**Setup:** [hackerrank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com) → choose “Data Science” or “Python” / “SQL” tracks.

**How to use:**

* **Python Practice:**

  * Start with “Data Structures” → Arrays / Strings / Dictionaries
  * Progress to “Algorithms” → Sorting / Searching
* **SQL Practice:**

  * Focus on "Join" and "Advanced Select" sections
  * Practice **window functions** under “Advanced SQL”
* Use “Practice” → “Contests” to simulate **timed coding challenges**.

**Routine:**

* Solve **1 coding + 1 SQL daily**
* Use the discussion tab to learn **different approaches**.
* After 2–3 weeks, start **mock interviews** on HackerRank.

## **3. StrataScratch (SQL + DS case problems)**

**Purpose:** Real-world SQL + analytics / business case problems, great for DS interviews.

**Setup:** [stratascratch.com](https://www.stratascratch.com) → free signup

**How to use:**

* Focus on:

  * Joins: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL
  * Window functions: RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), SUM()/AVG() OVER()
  * Aggregations + filtering
* Problems are **company-specific (Amazon, Google, Uber)** → good prep for European interviews.
* You can also solve **Python data manipulation questions** on pandas.

**Routine:**

* Solve **1 SQL case daily** (e.g., “Find top 5 customers by revenue last month”)
* Try to **explain your solution as if in an interview**.

## **4. Kaggle (Python / ML / SQL)**

**Purpose:** Hands-on practice on real datasets, end-to-end ML pipeline practice.

**Setup:** [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com) → signup → explore datasets and notebooks

**How to use:**

* For coding: Use **Kaggle Notebooks** in Python.
* Focus on:

  * Arrays: numpy operations
  * Dictionaries: data aggregations, mapping, feature encoding
  * Strings: text preprocessing for NLP
* For SQL:

  * Some competitions allow SQL queries in **BigQuery datasets**
* Build **small projects**: 1–2 day mini-kernels → feature engineering, model training, visualization.

**Routine:**

* Daily: Python coding practice / data manipulation (1–2 hours)
* Weekly: Small project → try to include **join/merge operations** if combining multiple datasets.

## **5. Databricks Community Edition (PySpark / Big Data)**

**Purpose:** Practice large-scale data processing and Spark SQL. Useful for DS roles with **data engineering exposure**.

**Setup:** [databricks.com](https://databricks.com/) → Community Edition → free account

**How to use:**

* Create a cluster → write notebooks in **Python / PySpark / SQL**
* Focus areas:

  * **DataFrames / Spark SQL**
  * **Joins** (inner, outer, left/right)
  * **Window functions** (row_number, rank, dense_rank, over partitions)
  * GroupBy / aggregations
* Practice **small datasets → medium datasets** to simulate real-world pipelines
* Integrate with **Python ML libraries** for pipeline building (optional for DS interviews)

**Routine:**

* 2–3 small notebooks weekly focusing on **joins, windowing, and groupby**.
* Optional: Simulate a **mini ETL pipeline** and perform ML on Spark DataFrames.

## **Daily Routine Example (2–3 hrs / day)**

| Time       | Platform      | Focus                                |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 30–45 mins | LeetCode      | Python arrays, strings, dictionaries |
| 30–45 mins | HackerRank    | SQL joins & window functions         |
| 30 mins    | StrataScratch | Business case SQL / analytics        |
| 30–45 mins | Kaggle        | Data manipulation / mini ML projects |
| 15–30 mins | Databricks    | Spark SQL + window functions         |

* Alternate **Python/SQL** focus per day.
* Track progress → repeat harder questions until fully confident.

If you want, I can **make a 6-week progressive plan with specific topics per day for Python + SQL + ML**, so you can follow it exactly like a bootcamp for DS interview prep.

Do you want me to do that?
